        It's actually very good to define a linear subspace as a span because in applied fields whenever claiming something is a vector space a basis is usually also presented. However, then coordinates and change of basis have to be emphasized. In [LADL], vector spaces are defined abstractly first and then matrices are defined as matrices under basis. In [Hoffman], after vector spaces are axiomatically introduced, we see a chapter of Gaussian elimination and this provides good examples later. In [Qiu], vector spaces are introduced very late. In [Strang] there's a lot of emphasis on the splitting between row space and null space.

        The point of introducing many matrix decompositions, especially <em>LU</em> and <em>QR</em>, can be confusing, especially without a lot of discussion on basis. The decompositions are usually better done by computers and the procedures will be clearer.

        Implicit function theorem seems to be not discussed.
