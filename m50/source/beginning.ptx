    <title>What and why</title>
    <p>
      It's 2025 and ChatGPT has been there for a while. If you searched more you might also know Claude and Llama. They solve difficult math problems. I personally witnessed someone cheating with ChatGPT at a math exam. The obvious question in the air is: why are we still studying, suffering from studying, and required to suffer from studying, math, something computers are eventually going to be good at?
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the following paragraphs from <url href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~tbjw/ila/overview.html"><pubtitle>Interactive Linear Algebra</pubtitle></url> fulfilling:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This text is roughly half computational and half conceptual in nature. The main goal is to present a library of linear algebra tools, and more importantly, to teach a conceptual framework for understanding which tools should be applied in a given context.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Matlab can find the answer faster than you can, then your question is just an algorithm: this is not real problem solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        The subtle part of the subject lies in understanding <em>what computation to ask the computer to do for you</em><mdash/>it is far less important to know how to perform computations that a computer can do better than you anyway.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      We need to ask the correct questions. Problems in the wild don't come in particular shapes as in prep books. There're no checklists or procedures for you to follow. In 20 years there will be very different problems that need you to solve. The real important thing is not <em>how</em> to do, but <em>what</em> to do and <em>why</em> doing so.

    <title>Idea</title>
    <p>
      We are going to talk a lot about ideas (what and why), and you are going to find out the recipes (how) yourself. This is a grand adventure, and we human have been trying so hard to grasp the most delicate ideas from the thin air.
      <!-- It might sound a little bit unsafe, but remember there're plenty of companions around. It's 2025 and we have services like ChatGPT, channels like 3Blue1Brown, platforms like Khan Academy, open textbooks like <url href="https://activecalculus.org/">this</url> and <url href="https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~tbjw/ila/">this</url>. Team up with other people from class, Reddit, StackExchange, or even Twitter: there are so many people have been trying hard to grasp the most delicate ideas from the thin air. -->
      Regularly colleagues of mine tell me that they eventually learned linear algebra <q>the right way</q> only many years after graduation. We are struggling together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are two quotes from completely different communities. One from Schoenberg's <pubtitle>Style and Idea</pubtitle>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        In comparison with all developments in mechanics, a tool like a pair of pliers might seem simple. I always admired the mind which invented it. In order to understand the problem which this inventor had to overcome one must imagine the state of mechanics before its invention. The idea of fixing the crosspoint of the two crooked arms so that the two smaller segments in front would move in the opposite direction to the larger segments at the back, thus multiplying the power of the man who squeezed them to such an extent that he could cut wire<mdash/>this idea can only have been conceived by a genius. Certainly more complicated and better tools exist today, and there may come a time when the use of the pliers and other similar tools may become superfluous. The tool itself may fall into disuse, but the idea behind it can never become obsolete. And therein lies the difference between a mere style and a real idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>An idea can never perish.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is very regrettable that so many contemporary composers care so much about style and so little about idea. From this came such notions as the attempt to compose in ancient styles, using their mannerisms, limiting oneself to the little that one can thus express and to the insignificance of the musical configurations which can be produced with such equipment.
      </p>

      Another from GothamChess <url href="https://youtu.be/qK1oN9dBs5A?t=749">I'm Cancelling Guess The Elo</url>:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The entire point of putting the knight on e4 in the Nimso, is to take on c3 with the bishop, and build behind your knight with f5. That's the whole point. This is the point. And then you go here and do all the good stuff. Why would you play knight e4? And now<ellipsis/> This is [_]. Bishop e7, but now you just have nothing. You didn't even play f5. Oh! Why did he hang a pawn? Just nobody<ellipsis/> I'm gonna cry<ellipsis/>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the problem with intermediate level chess. This is the problem. You buy a course for 70 dollars when it's 50 percent off that was made by Anish Giri or something. You can't even explain what the whole point of the opening is! If I ask you to explain the point of this position to a 5-year-old, you couldn't do it! What's the point of this whole opening? What is<ellipsis/> What are all these moves fighting against? This square! White would like to take the center with everything at the<ellipsis/>
      </p>
      <p>
        Underneath every sophisticated chess opening is a fundamental idea. That's why white does this: to slowly build for the center. All the moves are battling for one square. And you just lost it. You're just giving white all the central space. That's what<ellipsis/> I mean, what are these openings, what, what are you<ellipsis/> Just e4 here and black is dead: black has no play ever. What is knight a6? Where is the knight going?

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-abstraction">
    <title>Abstraction</title>
    <p>
      Ideas tend to be encapsuled in abstractions because that hides the irrelevants and highlights the important. Frequently we need to unpack abstractions, <ie/> to figure out what they even mean, so that we can talk about what to do and why doing so. Think hard and make sure you understand the meaning of every math statement, before even thinking about procedures and reasonings. If you cannot explain, you then don't understand, so try again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I first learned the point of abstraction from <pubtitle>Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective</pubtitle> by Bryant and O'Hallaron.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The use of <em>abstractions</em> is one of the most important concepts in computer science. For example, one aspect of good programming practice is to formulate a simple application program interface (API) for a set of functions that allow programmers to use the code without having to delve into its inner workings. Different programming languages provide different forms and levels of support for abstraction, such as Java class declarations and C function prototypes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have already been introduced to several of the abstractions seen in computer systems, as indicated in Figure 1.18. On the processor side, the <em>instruction set architecture</em> provides an abstraction of the actual processor hardware. With this abstraction, a machine-code program behaves as if it were executed on a processor that performs just one instruction at a time. The underlying hardware is far more elaborate, executing multiple instructions in parallel, but always in a way that is consistent with the simple, sequential model. By keeping the same execution model, different processor implementations can execute the same machine code while offering a range of cost and performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the operating system side, we have introduced three abstractions: <em>files</em> as an abstraction of I/O devices, <em>virtual memory</em> as an abstraction of program memory, and <em>processes</em> as an abstraction of a running program. To these abstractions we add a new one: the <em>virtual machine</em>, providing an abstraction of the entire computer, including the operating system, the processor, and the programs.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It's difficult to realize how far abstractions have been progressing without looking at history. Here are course recommendations for students in science or engineering at Stanford, taken from Stanford Bulletin Archive.

The multivariable calculus portion includes unconstrained optimization via gradients and Hessians (used for energy minimization), constrained optimization (via Lagrange multipliers, crucial in economics), gradient descent and the multivariable Chain Rule (which underlie many machine learning algorithms, such as backpropagation), and Newton's method (an ingredient in GPS and robotics). The course emphasizes computations alongside an intuitive understanding of key ideas.
