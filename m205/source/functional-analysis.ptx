    <p>
        Relative operations. The interior of <m>A</m> in a subset <m>U</m> under the subspace topology is <m> ( A \cup U^{\text{c}} )^{\circ} \cap U </m> and the closure in <m>U</m> is <m> \overline{ A \cap U } \cap U </m>. In particular, taking closure is a local operation. As a result, <m> ( \overline{A} )^{\circ} </m> is the set of points which have a neighborhood where <m>A</m> is dense under the subspace topology.

        Subbase. Given a family of subsets, all finite intersections of them form a base [p. 115 Prop. 4.3]. Given a base, arbitrary unions of members form a topology [ibid. Prop. 4.2]. Therefore, the topology generated by a family of subsets is precisely composed of arbitrary unions of finite intersections of members [ibid. Prop. 4.4].

    <p>
        Countable axioms. First countability enables sequence arguments [p. 116 Prop. 4.6], and metric spaces are first countable. Without first countability sequence arguments may not work [p. 125], but the generalization net arguments always work [p. 126 Prop. 4.18<ndash/>20]. Second countability implies separability [ibid. Prop. 4.5], and separable metric spaces are second countable [p. 118 Ex. 5]. Second countable normal spaces are metrizable [p. 145 Thm. 4.58]. First countability plus compactness implies sequential compactness [p. 130 Ex. 40], and sequential compact metric spaces are compact [ibid.].
    </p>
    <p>
        Locally compact Hausdorff spaces. The key property of LCH spaces is that we can always find a lot of precompact open sets <m>V</m> between a compact set <m>K</m> and an open set <m>U</m> in the sense that <m> K \subseteq V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq U </m> [p. 131 Prop. 4.31]. Noncompact LCH spaces can be one-point compactified [p. 132 Prop. 4.36], and the Stone<ndash/>ÄŒech compactification of completely regular spaces is a generalization [p. 145].
    </p>
    <p>
        Characterization of topologies. For functions, convergence in the product topology means pointwise convergence [p. 120 Prop. 4.12], and convergence in the uniform or the compact uniform topology have the literal meanings. On a <m>\sigma</m>-compact LCH space, the compact uniform topology is metrizable [p. 135 Ex. 56d].
    </p>
    <p>
        Banach algebras. The Stone<ndash/>Weierstrass theorem states that on a compact Hausdorff space proper closed subalgebras of continuous functions separating points are vanishing ideals of a point [p. 139 Thm. 4.45]. Moreover, closed ideals one-one correspond to closed subsets [p. 142 Ex. 70e] and maximal proper ideals to points [p. 143 Ex. 71c].
