    <title>Measures</title>
    <p>
      *Non-measurable sets. In 1d one construction is given by taking representatives of <m>\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}</m> [p. 20]. In (&gt;=3)-d the Banach<ndash/>Tarski paradox [ibid.] provides examples because the congruent sets have to be non-measurable. The existence of non-measurable sets is unprovable in ZF.
    </p>

      †Carathéodory's extension theorem. Given any function assigning sizes to some of the subsets, we can construct an outer measure from the minimal covering effort [p. 29 Prop. 1.10]. Given an outer measure, measurable sets defined by the Carathéodory's criterion form a <m>\sigma</m>-algebra, on which the outer measure restricts to a measure [ibid. Thm. 1.11]. If the initial function is a premeasure, these two steps provide an extension of the premeasure to a measure [p. 31 Prop. 1.13]. Such extension is unique if the space is <m>\sigma</m>-finite [ibid. Thm. 1.14].
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebesgue<ndash/>Stieltjes measure. Intervals <m> ( a, b ] </m> form an elementary family and thus generate an algebra [p. 23 Prop. 1.7]. Assigning <m> \mu ( a, b ] = F (b) - F (a) </m> for suitable <m>F</m> gives a premeasure [p. 33 Prop. 1.15]. By extension, this assignment gives the one-one correspondence between increasing càdlàg functions up to constants and locally finite measures on the real line, <ie/> between distribution functions and Lebesgue<ndash/>Stieltjes measures [p. 35 Thm. 1.16]. Such measures are regular and thus Radon [p. 36 Thm. 1.18]. Higher-dimensional Lebesgue measure are also regular and thus Radon [ibid. Thm. 2.40]. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cantor set. Associated with the Cantor set there's the Cantor function [p. 39] and the corresponding Cantor measure. We can construct a Lebesgue but not Borel-measurable set using the Cantor function [p. 48 Ex. 9c]. The Cantor measure is supported on the Cantor set. The Cantor measure is a singular continuous measure on the real line [p. 106].
    </p>
    <p>
      †Monotone class theorem. The <m>\lambda</m>-system generated by a <m>\pi</m>-system is a <m>\sigma</m>-algebra [p. 66 Thm. 2.35]. If a property on a finite product is satisfied by coordinate rectangles (<m>\pi</m>) and is closed under increasing limits (usually done by the monotone convergence theorem, <m>\lambda</m>), the property is then true over the whole <m>\sigma</m>-algebra.

    <title>Integration</title>
    <p>
      Counter-examples. Four classical examples are blowing up, running away, spreading out, and branching off [p. 61]. The first three explain the deficit in Fatou's lemma and are controlled in the dominated convergence theorem or even by the convergence of norms [p. 59 Ex. 21]. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Modes of convergence. Convergence in norm implies convergence in measure [p. 61 Prop. 2.29].Convergence in measure implies a.e. convergence of a subsequence [ibid. Thm. 2.30]. Almost uniform convergence implies convergence in measure and a.e. convergence [p. 63 Ex. 39]. If the measure is finite, a.e. convergence implies almost uniform convergence [p. 62 Thm. 2.33]. 
    </p>
    <p>
      †Uniform integrability. One equivalent definition of absolute continuity <m> \nu \ll \mu </m> is <m> \nu (E) \to 0 </m> when <m> \mu (E) \to 0 </m> [p. 89 Thm. 3.5]. Applying to <m> f \mu \ll \mu </m>, we get the (uniform) integrability of <m>f</m> [p. 52 Ex. 16]. Convergence in <m>L^1</m> is equivalent to convergence in measure together with uniform integrability [p. 92 Ex. 11b].

    <title>Differentiation</title>
    <p>
      Hardy<ndash/>Littlewood maximal function. The maximal theorem states that the weak <m>L^1</m> norm of the maximal function is controlled by the <m>L^1</m> norm [p. 96 Thm. 3.17]. However, the maximal function is almost never in <m>L^1</m> [p. 100 Ex. 22]. One proof of the maximal theorem makes use of the Vitali covering lemma [p. 95 Lm. 3.15].
    </p>
    <p>
      Lebesgue differentiation theorem. Given a locally integrable function, local averages a.e. converge to function values by continuous approximation [p. 97 Thm. 3.18]. Moreover, local oscillation averages also a.e. converge to zero by a density argument [p. 98 Thm. 3.20]. Meanwhile, local densities of a regular measure singular to the Lebesgue measure a.e. converge to zero [p. 99 Thm. 3.22]. Applying these theorems to the Lebesgue decomposition, we see an increasing function on the real line is a.e. differentiable since it can be modified to a distribution function [p. 101 Thm. 3.23]. Integrating the derivative we get the absolutely continuous part [p. 105 Prop. 3.30]. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Functions of bounded variation. Real BV functions are differences between increasing functions since we can recover parts by averaging with the total variation function [p. 102 Lm. 3.26]. As a result, BV càdlàg functions up to constants one-one correspond to signed measures, extending the correspondence of Lebesgue<ndash/>Stieltjes measures. The total variation of a BV function coincides with the total variation of the corresponding measure [p. 104 Thm. 3.29]. The length of a rectifiable curve is the total variation of a parameterization [p. 108 Ex. 38].
