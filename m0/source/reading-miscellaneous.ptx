    <title>Linear independence</title>
    <exercise>
      <statement>

          Explain in your own words how to determine linear independence by solving linear systems.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Explain in your own words why linear dependence means we can always find one vector that is a linear combination of the other vectors.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Explain in your own words why the span of several vectors will be the same if we add in another vector that is a linear combination of the other vectors.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a set of vectors, how to produce a linearly independent subset while keeping the span?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          (1) If we have an linearly independent set, adding a new vector either retains linear independence, or the new vector is in the span of the previous ones. (2) In the latter case removing the vector doesn't affect the span.
        </p>
        <hint>
          <p>
            (1) and (2) come from the last two questions above.
