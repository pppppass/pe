    <title>Vectors</title>
    <p>
      A set is a collection of things. The set of fruits contains apple, banana, orange, peach, ananac, <etc/> The set of integers is <m> \mathbb{Z} = \{ \cdots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \cdots \} </m>. The set <m>\mathbb{R}</m> of real numbers contains <m>1</m>, <m>-10000.1</m>, <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, and <m>\mathrm{e}^{\pi}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vector is a tuple of numbers. An <m>n</m>-vector has <m>n</m> entries, and <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> is the set of all <m>n</m>-tuples of real numbers. Two ways to write the same vector are <m> ( 1, 2, 3 ) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} </m>. <em>However, <m> \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \end{bmatrix} </m> means something different.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Vectors are added and scaled entry-wise:
      <me>
        \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 5 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 7 \\ 9 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad 3 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 6 \\ 9 \end{bmatrix}
      </me>.
      <em>Vectors cannot be multiplied entry-wise.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Strictly speaking, vectors are differences between points. Starting from a point and moving by a vector we arrive at another point. The vector from <m> (1, 2) </m> to <m> (3, 4) </m> is the same as the one from <m> (0, 0) </m> to <m> (2, 2) </m>: the movements are the same vector <m> \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} </m>. Sometimes people equate points with vectors by starting from the origin, so <m> \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} </m> can mean either the point <m> (2, 2) </m> or the movement from the origin to <m> (2, 2) </m>.

    <title>Vector equations</title>
    <p>
      A linear combination of <m>\mathbf{u}</m>, <m>\mathbf{v}</m>, <m>\mathbf{w}</m> is a vector <m> a \mathbf{u} + b \mathbf{v} + c \mathbf{w} </m> for some numbers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>. For example,
      <me>
        \mathbf{u}, \quad \mathbf{0} = 0 \mathbf{u}, \quad -\mathbf{u} = (-1) \mathbf{u}, \quad \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{u}, \quad 100 \mathbf{u}, \quad (k^2 + 4) \mathbf{u} \text{ for some } k
      </me>
      are all linear combinations of <m>\mathbf{u}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A linear system can be written as a vector equation:
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}
        x + 2 y \amp= 3 \\
        3 x + 4 y \amp = 7
        \end{aligned}
        \quad \text{vs.} \quad
        x \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} + y \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix}
      </me>.

    <title>Spans</title>
    <p>
      The span of <m>\mathbf{u}</m>, <m>\mathbf{v}</m>, <m>\mathbf{w}</m> is the set of all possible linear combinations of <m>\mathbf{u}</m>, <m>\mathbf{v}</m>, <m>\mathbf{w}</m>. In other words, the span is <m> \{ a \mathbf{u} + b \mathbf{v} + c \mathbf{w} : a, b, c \in \mathbb{R} \} </m>, <ie/> it is composed of all possible <m> a \mathbf{u} + b \mathbf{v} + c \mathbf{w} </m> when <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m> run over real numbers. Just like the set of sweet fruits is the set of all possible fruits that are sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vector <m>\mathbf{p}</m> being in the span of <m>\mathbf{u}</m>, <m>\mathbf{v}</m>, <m>\mathbf{w}</m> means we can find numbers <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m> such that <m> \mathbf{p} = x \mathbf{u} + y \mathbf{v} + z \mathbf{w} </m>. Not being in the span means we cannot find the numbers. Just like apple being among sweet fruits means apple is sweet, and lemon not being among sweet fruits means lemon is not sweet.
