          Explain in your own words what <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m> is. Why write <m>\mathbb{R}</m> and why 3? How many things are inside <m>\mathbb{R}^3</m>?

          Explain the following.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Points and vectors are different things. Vectors are differences between points. Starting from a point and moving by a vector we arrive at another point. Sometimes we regard points as vectors by taking differences to the origin. That's why in most of the later pictures we draw vectors starting at the origin.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Why? The width of <m>v + w</m> is the sum of the widths, and likewise with the heights.

          <p>
            In fact, there are infinitely many scenarios of {all linear combinations of a vector}. However, many scenarios are essentially the same. There are only two essentially different scenarios.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Asking whether or not a vector equation has a solution is the same as asking if a given vector is a linear combination of some other given vectors.
