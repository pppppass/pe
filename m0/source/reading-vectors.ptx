    <title>Vectors</title>
    <p>
      A set is a collection of things. The set of fruits contains apple, banana, orange, peach, ananac, <etc/> The set of integers is <m> \mathbb{Z} = \{ \cdots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \cdots \} </m>. The set <m>\mathbb{R}</m> of real numbers contains <m>1</m>, <m>-10000.1</m>, <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, and <m>\mathrm{e}^{\pi}</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vector is a tuple of numbers. An <m>n</m>-vector has <m>n</m> entries, and <m>\mathbb{R}^n</m> is the set of all <m>n</m>-tuples of real numbers. Some ways to write the same vector are <me> ( 1, 2, 3 ) = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \end{bmatrix}^{\top} </me>, where <m>\top</m> stands for transpose. <em>However, <m> \begin{bmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \end{bmatrix} </m> means something different.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Vectors are added and scaled entry-wise: <me> \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 5 \\ 6 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ 7 \\ 9 \end{bmatrix}, \qquad 3 \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 6 \\ 9 \end{bmatrix} </me>. <em>Vectors cannot be multiplied entry-wise.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Strictly speaking, vectors are differences between points. Starting from a point and moving by a vector we arrive at another point. The vector from <m> (1, 2) </m> to <m> (3, 4) </m> is the same as the one from <m> (0, 0) </m> to <m> (2, 2) </m>: the movements are the same vector <m> \begin{bmatrix} 2 \amp 2 \end{bmatrix}^{\top} </m>. Sometimes people equate points with vectors by starting from the origin, so <m> \begin{bmatrix} 2 \amp 2 \end{bmatrix}^{\top} </m> can mean either the point <m> (2, 2) </m> or the movement from the origin to <m> (2, 2) </m>.
